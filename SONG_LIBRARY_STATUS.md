# 🎸 Chorde - Song Library Status

## Current Library Status

### ✅ Public Domain Collection
The repository currently includes a curated selection of Public Domain and Traditional songs, ensuring the codebase is safe for public distribution.

**Songs Included:**
- Amazing Grace
- Kumbaya
- Oh Susanna
- Will the Circle Be Unbroken
- Oh My Darling Clementine
- Greensleeves
- House of the Rising Sun
- Down in the Valley

## Strategy

### 1. Public Safe Repository
The public repository ships with **only public domain content**. This allows the project to be open-sourced without copyright infringement risks.

### 2. User Imports
Users can import their own songs using the import features. This places the responsibility of copyright compliance on the end-user for their personal library.

## Technical Notes

- **Seed Data**: Located in `src/data/seedSongs.ts` (Public Domain only).
- **Import Scripts**: Tools available in `scripts/` to help users import their own collections.
